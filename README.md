# Anime Searcher

Anime Searcher is a single-page frontend application designed for educational purposes. The app utilizes the public Jikan API as a middleware to access the MyAnimeList database. The application consists of two main parts:
1.  **Anime Search**: Users can search for anime titles using the search bar in the header. If the search field is left empty, the application displays the top 24 anime titles.
    
2.  **Personal Reviews**: Users can write, modify, or delete their personal reviews for anime titles. Clicking the "Write/change review" button, which appears on top of the anime card, opens a modal window for adding or editing existing reviews. The "Delete review" button, available only in the reviews section and on top of the anime card, allows users to remove their reviews. After submitting the modal window, the review is added or updated in the reviews section. Users can access the reviews section by clicking the "Review" button, and the button is highlighted when they are in the reviews section.
